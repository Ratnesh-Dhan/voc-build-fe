          definition and most distinctively, references from popular movies. These references
          include: Movie Clips: Short snippets from films showing the word in use, helping to
          understand its context and usage. Quotes: Iconic lines from movies where the word is
          featured, enhancing memorability. This approach not only helps in understanding the
          meaning of the word but also in appreciating its nuance and power in storytelling.
